### Built with Ruby on Rails & Postgres

This applcation is a personal portfolio site for my career milestones and technical projects. It was built with the Ruby on Rails framework, along with a Postgresql database. The site is hosted on a Virtual Private Server on Digital Ocean. The site is served using the nginx configured as a reverse proxy, with the request-response cycle handled by Passenger/Capistrano.
